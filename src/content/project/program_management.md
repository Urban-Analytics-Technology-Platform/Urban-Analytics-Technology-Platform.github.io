Kelin Yue, our Programme Manager, and Mariam Arakelyan, our Research Project Manager, work together to implement a robust project management framework. Their expertise ensures that research projects are delivered on time, within budget, and aligned with agreed milestones and impact objectives. They oversee every stage of the project lifecycle, from planning and organisation to execution and completion. Beyond project delivery, the team actively supports community engagement by coordinating activities such as conferences, newsletters, and the launch of new initiatives, fostering collaboration and knowledge-sharing across the community.
 
Jennifer Ding, our Research Application Manager, focuses on maximizing the sustainability and real-world impact of research. She works to develop and guide the application of research outputs, ensuring they are accessible and beneficial to a wide range of stakeholders
