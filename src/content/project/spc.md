The Synthetic Population Catalyst (SPC) makes it easier for researchers to work with synthetic population data in Great Britain. It combines a rich variety of data sources and modelling techniques and presents its results either as a fully customisable tool or as a data product with pre-compiled areas directly accessible from the website. SPC is constructed around the Middle-Layer Output Areas (MSOAs) scale, with some variables precise up to the Output Area scale. It is optimised for the year 2020, although files for 2012 up to 2039 are provided. The output files can then feed dynamic models, such as ABMs, for multiple purposes where an enriched synthetic population file is required. SPC includes a comprehensive set of variables such as socio-demographic characteristics, daily activities, and other extra data to help model the complexity of British society.
