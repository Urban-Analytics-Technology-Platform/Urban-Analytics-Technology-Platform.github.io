Hussein Mahfouz is a PhD student at the Institute for Transport Studies at the University of Leeds, focusing on network design from a decarbonisation perspective. His research interests encompass activity-based and agent-based modeling, network design problems, and the potential contribution of ride-sharing towards decarbonisation goals.

Prior to starting his PhD, Hussein worked as a transport consultant in Cairo on projects for International Finance Institutions, the public sector, and NGOs. Previous projects he worked on include the Greater Cairo Region Mobility Assessment and Public Transport Improvement Study (MAPTIS), and the Ghana Urban Mobility and Accessibility Project (GUMAP).

He came to the Turing as an [Enrichment Student](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/former-enrichment-students/hussein-mahfouz) and has worked on developing a reproducible [activity-based modelling pipeline](https://github.com/Urban-Analytics-Technology-Platform/acbm) that can be used for agent-based transport simulations.
