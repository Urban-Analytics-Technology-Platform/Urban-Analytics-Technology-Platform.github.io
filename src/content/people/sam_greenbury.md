Sam Greenbury is a Senior Research Data Scientist in the [Research Engineering Group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-engineering) with a background in physics, computational biology, machine learning, and healthcare.

Following a PhD at the University of Cambridge in the [TCM Group](https://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/) investigating fundamental properties of biological systems, he developed and led on analysis at the Department of Health for national policy priorities. He subsequently spent time at Imperial College London as a postdoc in both mathematics ([Centre for Mathematics of Precision Healthcare](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics-precision-healthcare/)) and biomedical data science ([ITMAT Data Science Group](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/itmat-data-science-group/)) groups where he developed and applied Bayesian inference, machine learning and data science approaches to healthcare data.

At the Turing, he has worked on projects in health ([Learning machines](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/learning-machines-drift)), trustworthy digital identity ([Trustchain](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/trustchain)), and urban analytics ([Urban Analytics Technology Platform](https://urban-analytics-technology-platform.github.io/)).

He is passionate about writing code (particularly in Rust) to model/simulate systems/data.
