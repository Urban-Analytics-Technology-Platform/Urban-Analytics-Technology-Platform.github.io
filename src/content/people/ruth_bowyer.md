Ruth is a Post-Doctoral Research Associate, having completed her PhD in Genetic Epidemiology at King’s College London in 2019. She joined the Turing in April 2022, where she works on the DyME-CHH project to develop a microsimulation model to identify adaptation strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change and increased temperatures on human health. She currently also works part-time in KCL’s Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, where she has been a post-doc since 2019.

Ruth has contributed to over 50 published research articles on a wide range of topics. She was previously co-lead in organising the London Microbiome Meeting, and currently facilitates a bimonthly multimorbidity statistical community of practice with the University of Exeter GEMINI project. Ruth prefers to work across disciplines and was co-investigator on a 2022 NERC awarded discipline hopping-grant, where she worked closely with colleagues in KCL Geography. In 2018, she was awarded an early career researcher award to disseminate her thesis findings in collaboration with an artist, leading to a 3m long, mulitcoloured, visual interpretation of her work.
