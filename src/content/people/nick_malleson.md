At the Alan Turing Institue, Nick is Group Leader for Digital Twins in the Urban Analytics Programme.

Dr Malleson is Professor of Spatial Science at the Centre for Spatial Analysis and Policy at the School of Geography, University of Leeds, UK.

He has a PhD in Geography and undergraduate degrees in Computer Science (BSc) and Multidiciplinary Informatics (MSc).

Most of his research focuses on the development of computer models that can help to understand social phenomena. He has particular interests in simulations of crime patterns, and in models that can be used to describe the flows of people around cities.

More recently, he has become in interested in how 'big data', agent-based modelling, and smart cities initiatives can be used to reduce the impacts of problems like pollution or crime.
