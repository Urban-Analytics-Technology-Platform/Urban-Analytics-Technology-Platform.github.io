At the Alan Turing Institue, Nick is Group Leader for Digital Twins in the Urban Analytics Programme.

He is a Professor of Spatial Science and Leader of the [Institute for Spatial Data Science](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography-research-centre-spatial-analysis-policy) at the [School of Geography](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography), [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk), UK.

He has a PhD in Geography and undergraduate degrees in Computer Science (BSc) and Multidiciplinary Informatics (MSc).

His research leverages techniques developed in computer science, statistics and machine learning, applying them to critical social problems that have a strong geographical context. He is best known for his work on agent-based modelling (an individual-level simulation approach) and in the development of machine-learning and geographical information science techniques to solve problems in the domains of criminal justice, mobility and health.
