I'm a Research Data Scientist in REG. Having grown up halfway across the world in Malaysia,
I did my undergraduate and PhD degrees at Oxford, both in chemistry; my PhD involved the design of new experiments and software to optimise data acquisition procedures.
I love writing in functional languages (especially Haskell!), though during my time on Urban Analytics I've focused on both the DemoLand web frontend as well as various parts of popgetter.
Other interests include, in no particular order: classical music (I play a couple of instruments), Switch games, waterfowl, Jane Austen novels (and adaptations), and occasional baking (not the waterfowl!).
