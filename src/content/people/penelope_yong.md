I'm a Research Data Scientist in REG. I'm from Petaling Jaya, Malaysia, and grew up both there and in Singapore. I did my undergraduate and PhD degrees at Oxford, both in chemistry. Although I started off thinking I'd do traditional wet-lab chemistry, I eventually settled on nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for my PhD, where I worked on designing new experiments and software to optimise data acquisition procedures. I love writing in functional languages, especially Haskell, but right now I'm working on the DemoLand web frontend. Other interests include, in no particular order: classical music (I play a couple of instruments), Switch games, waterfowl, Jane Austen novels (and adaptations), and occasional baking (not the waterfowl!).
