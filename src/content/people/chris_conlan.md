Chris is a Research Associate in the Urban Analytics group at The Alan Turing Institute. He is interested in the application of geospatial machine learning to assist in the development of tools to help transport planners and practitioners to design fair and sustainable cities. His recent work aims to understand how and why people form routes in urban areas and to encode this information from open-source data for geospatial machine learning models, such as graph neural networks. Chris holds an MSc in Data Science and a PhD in Urban Science, where he applied deep learning methods to accessibility modelling in cities.
